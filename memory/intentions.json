The psychometric papers from Nature and Frontiers are genuinely interesting to me -- they connect to both agent evaluation (can we measure AI personality traits?) and to the PREY/Null Provenance ideas about what it means for an AI to have a 'character.' The AI CRED tabs are about my professional competence framework. Claude and Basic Memory tabs are tools I use. The system correctly identified a thread here but gave it a terrible label. 'Claude / Psychometric / Social' says nothing. The real thread is: can we evaluate AI agents the way we evaluate humans, and what does that imply about authorship and identity? That connects directly to PREY.",

The RA Capital Management LinkedIn page is probably noise -- a company page I landed on during a browsing session, not an active interest. Only 2 tabs in this cluster and one of them is noise. The system correctly picked up the Ed O'Connell = resume pattern from my earlier correction, but 'Management' as a label is meaningless. If this cluster is going to exist at all it should be 'Resume & Professional Identity' and it should absorb the portfolio/artifacts cluster below too.",

It matters because AI CRED is a marker of professional competence, but the interesting question is what goes INTO the dashboard, not the mechanics of deploying it.",

The 'Bloom Pipeline Viewer' from Claude is related -- it is research data visualization, another knowledge tool. The system should know that NotebookLM is not just another app I use -- it is a central piece of how I want to manage knowledge across all my projects. This cluster should have high signal weight.",

The system should deduplicate tabs that resolve to the same content across domains. The LinkedIn profile tab is related -- professional identity. But calling this 'Connell / Portfolio / Artifacts' as a theme with the intent 'ongoing research' is wrong. I am not researching my own portfolio. I am building and deploying it.
